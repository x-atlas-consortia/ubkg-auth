# Script for calling Docker compose to control the ubkg-auth services container of UBKGBox.
# This script differs from the docker-deployment.sh script primarily in that it allows for
# building a new image.

# Arguments and functions:
# 1. check
#    Verifies the location of the app.cfg file for ubkg-api that is to be mounted externally.
# 2. config
#    Calls Docker compose config.
# 3. build
#    a. Refreshes ubkg-auth source from the current branch. The src directory is copied under
#       the docker directory, and it is this src that the Dockerfile copies to the image.
#    b. Recalculates content of BUILD file in the container from branch information.
#    c. Recalculates content of the VERSION file in the container from the ubkg-auth repository.
#       The UBKGBox deployment version will correspond to the version of the ubkg-ath.
#    d. Builds a new image.
# 4. start
#    Builds a container from the current image with docker compose up.
# 5. stop, down
#    Executes corresponding docker compose commands on the current container.
# -- Divergence from standard hubmapconsortium API image build
# 6. push
#    Pushes images in both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 to Docker Hub.
