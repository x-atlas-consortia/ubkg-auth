# ubkg-auth
An API to authenticate ubkg consumers against the umls API.

The intended use case for **ubkg-api** is a service component of the
[UBKGBox](https://github.com/x-atlas-consortia/ubkg-box) Docker Compose multi-container application.

This repository contains source for:
- an authentication API, in Flask
- a Docker build with an nginx host running the API

Instructions to build the Docker are in the README.md file in the __/docker_ directory.
